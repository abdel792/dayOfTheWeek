# Presentation

This addon  for NVDA allows you  to find   a day of the week corresponding to a chosen date.

It adds an item in the NVDA Tools menu named "Day of the week" to allow you to open a dialog box composed of 3 controls:

1. A listbox to choose your date.    
This date can be entered directly from the keyboard, entering the day in 2 digits, followed by a slash, then the month in 2 digits, followed by a slash, then the year in 4 digits.
#. A button named "Get the day" to display a messageBox containing your day.
#. A button \"Close" to close the dialog.

You can close this dialogue just by pressing the key escapes.

You can assign a keyboard shortcut to call this dialogBox in "Input gestures" menu and more precisely, in the "Tools" category.
