This add-on allows you to find a day of the week corresponding to a chosen date.

It adds an item in the NVDA Tools menu named "Day of the week", to open a dialog composed of 3 controls:
*	 A listbox to choose your date. This date can be entered directly from the keyboard, entering the day in 2 digits, followed by a slash, then the month in 2 digits, followed by a slash, then the year in 4 digits.
*	 A "OK" button to display a messageBox containing your day.
*	 A "Cancel" button to close the dialog.

## Notes ##
*	 You can close this dialog just by pressing Escape.
*	 You can assign a shortcut to open the dialog in "Input gestures" menu and, more precisely, in the "Tools" category.

## Changes for 1.0 ##
*	 Initial version.
